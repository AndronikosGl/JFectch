## Running project
To run jfetch, use `cd dist` and then `java -jar JFetch.jar`

## Common problems and solutions
1) JFetch relies on bash to fetch some information from your system. If it gives off any type of error such as `/bin/bash not found`
- You will need to copy the bash binary from its original place to /bin and re run the project or create a symbolic link
- You will need to make sure bash is installed on your system

2) JFetch requires execution permition to run
- You will have to use `chmod +x JFetch.jar` to give it permition to run
